**Topic:** Empower your team with ChatOps: Getting started with PoshBot

In the modern workplace, lots of communication occurs in chat. Imagine if you could write tools in PowerShell and share them with your team through the chat that you already use everyday.

This month, [Andrew Pla](https://twitter.com/andrewplatech) will talk about the benefits of ChatOps and how to bring automation and collaboration to your chat with PoshBot, a PowerShell-based bot framework. Enhance your chat with PowerShell!

Pizza will be provided.
